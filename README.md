## Directory Structure and File Contents
Because of GPU requirements, I wrote and ran all my scripts on Kaggle.
Follows a brief description of each script's content and purpose. In general, the scripts share the data reading and preprocessing segments, as well as plots and evaluation metrics. The main difference between scripts lays in the architecture used.
